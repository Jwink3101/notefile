# macOS Finder Tags Sync

This will do *bi-directional* sync of tags from Finder and Notefile. This is unlike other scripts that just note when a note is present. This will sync the actual tags.

It will keep a database of tags (with a settable location) of status so that deletes can also be tracked.

Must have `tag` installed: https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/tag

    $ brew install tag
